## Thank's

First of all, thanks to the team of Ironhack instructors (besides coders they are also psychologists, social workers, friends and have an indescribable patience).


I would also like to thank Traversy Media for the magnificent tutorial used as the basis for the game project. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0No1JDc6vE).

Special thanks to Luiz Filho, for his time to help me understand the code and input the multiplayer mode.

There were several other sources of research and relationship for the implementation of this project that I can not remember or not list in this list. But they were also of paramount importance for the completion of the project.
For these a special thank you.
